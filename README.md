### How to Play
#### Step 1
First you will need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your computer. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to read more about getting started with `node`, and [here](https://www.npmjs.com/) to read more about getting started with `npm`. If you have `npm` and `node` already installed skip to Step 2.

#### Step 2
Now you will want to install the node modules. To do this run the following command: `npm install`.

#### Step 3
Run the program! You can run the program using the command `node index.js`. By default, the program runs the Monty Hall Game 1,000,000 times. This can be changed by editing `index.js`. The variable `numberOfTurns` is the counter for how many times the game gets played. You can change it to whatever you want. It is declared on Line 11 of `index.js`.
